## Mission 

[marwari.info](https://marwari.info) aims to 
1. ✅ help people learn Marwari language
2. ✅ create an all-in-one resource portal for Marwari language
3. ✅ conserve Marwari language in pursuance of Article 29 of Indian Constitution
4. ✅ popularise Marwari for future generations.

## Long-term Vision

We have documented the medium-term and long-term plan in [PLAN.md](https://github.com/madrecha/marwaridictionary/blob/master/PLAN.md). We plan to have so many features. Stay tuned. 😊

## Who are we?

We are Chartered Accountants, but for you, we are the creators of marwaridictionary.blogspot.com 💪🏻

It was high time we moved from simple blog (that garnered lakhs of views) to a full-fledged Jamstack web-app. 

So, in due time, marwaridictionary.blogspot.com will also be redirected to marwari.info
