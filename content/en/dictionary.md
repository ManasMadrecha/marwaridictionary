## Introduction

Dictionaries can be monolingual or bilingual. In monolingual dictionaries, the word as well as its definitions are presented in the same language. On the other hand, a bilingual dictionary contains translations of the words of the first language into the second language. 

We have started with preparing a <strong>bilingual Marwari to English dictionary</strong>. Why? Because we feel that with this approach, we can quickly reach out to the English speakers who wish to learn Marwari language.

Of course, we will also try to prepare a bilingual English to Marwari dictionary. You too can help us to contribute to the community.
